forking old libxenon projects, making it compile and compiling with a libxenon fork

putting an option to run xenon.elf to all forked homebrew so you can switch between them instead of having to reboot

made it an organisation so it looks cooler and doesn't fill up my profile

not sure if it's gonna take a week until I'm bored of this or maybe less, but I hope someone out there will have fun with this
